# A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of servers that deliver web content to users based on their location. CDNs use a process called caching to store copies of files in data centers around the world, so that users can access content from a server closer to them. This reduces the distance data has to travel, which results in faster page load times and a better user experience


# Cross-origin refers to a mechanism that allows web applications to interact with resources in different domains
- An HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate which origins a browser can load resources from. CORS allows client browsers to check with third-party servers before transferring data.
