^2.4.6 -minor upgrade: parcel automatically upgrades the versions , safe to put caret;
~ - 2.3.4 - major verison upgrade like 3.0.1 released; automatically

- we only install parcel and so many files comes inside node_modules so parcel as a project needs its own dependencies and that sub dependencies needs their own dependencies and so on 
- this is knows as transitive dependencies;

- node_modules is a collection of dependencies that is required to run the project;
- import React from 'react'; means importing react from node modules in our project;
